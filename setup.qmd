# Setup {.unnumbered}

At the first step (assuming you already installed R with version higher than 4.1) we need to complete our package installation setup. 

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# pti is the list of packages to install from CRAN is 
pti <- c("remotes","ompr.roi","ompr","highs", "ROI")
pti <- pti[!(pti %in% installed.packages())]
if(length(pti) > 0){
  install.packages(pti)
}

# Plus currently ROI.plugin.highs is not listed in CRAN 
# therefore we get it from Gitlab location using remotes package
if(!("ROI.plugin.highs"%in% installed.packages()))
remotes::install_gitlab("roigrp/solver/roi.plugin.highs")
```

We will need

```{r}
library(ROI.plugin.highs)
library(ompr.roi)
library(ompr)
```

Optionally, you can get `tidyverse` and `readxl` as well for data manipulaton and reading from Excel files respectively.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
pti <- c("tidyverse","readxl")
pti <- pti[!(pti %in% installed.packages())]
if(length(pti) > 0){
  install.packages(pti)
}
```
